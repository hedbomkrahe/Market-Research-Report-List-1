<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monorail System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straddle Type</li><li>Suspended Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The monorail system market can be categorized into two main types: the straddle type and the suspended type. Straddle monorails have a beam that is elevated above ground, allowing vehicles to straddle the track, making them ideal for urban environments with limited space. In contrast, suspended monorails hang below the guideway, offering a unique ride experience and efficient travel in hilly or densely populated areas. Both types enhance urban mobility and reduce traffic congestion while promoting sustainable transportation solutions.</p></p>
